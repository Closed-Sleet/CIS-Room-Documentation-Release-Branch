# CIS-Room-Documentation-Release-Branch
This is the documentation for the CIS room at Pinkerton Academy. The documentation will cover most of the needed information about the room itself. This includes all the various PCs spec sheets, purpose/function, etc. Further documentation on specific aspects such as the VM server and the Docker server is available and linked within this documentation.
For those who want to update this documentation you can do so by commiting changes to this github repo. Access to such will be provided by Mr.eno himself. Feel free to make a branch or use this as a template to make your own version of the site before submitting it to Mr. Eno to be examined and commited.

This documentation was created initially by Lantis Hegg with further documentation provided by Thomas Philips and Connor Schuler.
John Buck helped with updates and styling.

    <h2>General Work Pcs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> AMD Ryzen 5 1600x (AIO coolers in use are old and will need replacement)</li>
      <li> 8GB or 16GB of DDR4 2133MHz single/dual channel RAM </li>
      <p class='SubText'>Most of them are running single channel which needs to be upgraded.</p>
      <li> Nvidia Low-profile GTX-1050 ti</li>
      <li> 1TB 2.5" HHD (Needs to be replaced with SSD)</li>
      <li> MSI B350 PC Mate</li>
      <li> Thermaltake smart 80+ bronze 650w PSU</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>These are very mid tier budget systems, capable of light gaming and workloads. Use these primarily for testout/cisco work and feel free to make changes to them with permission from Mr. Eno.</h3>
    <h3>If you want to do something or test something feel free to do so. This class has a lot of resources that are dedicated for your use. Most questions should be directed towards the L3's present in the class as they will generally be able to help with most issues/problems. Mr. Eno is a great resource if they can't help you. It is highly encouraged to do projects.</h3>

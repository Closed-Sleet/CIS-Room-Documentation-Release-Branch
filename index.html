    This source code is written by Lantis T. Hegg,
    Feel free to make a branch and change this as you will.
    I've done my best to make this as readable as possible
    with the intention that others would be updating it 
    down the line.

    If you don't know anything about HTML or CSS, here's a link to a useful basic tutorial
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg&t

    Mozilla also has some really good documentation:

    <h1> Computer Information Systems Room Documentation </h1>
    <p> The CIS room refers to Mr. Eno's classroom. </p>
    <p> This is the general documentation of the room. </p>
    <p> Please update this documentation as the room changes and gets upgraded. </p>
    
    <!-- Change this to your name if your in charge of the documentation,
         so people know who to go to with questions/concerns. -->

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> This documentation will cover almost everything in the CIS room from a hardware and software perspective. </p>
    <p style="float: clear;">If you want to do or test something feel free to do so. This class has a lot of resources that are dedicated for your use. 
      Most questions should be directed towards the L3's present in the class as they will generally be able to help with most issues/problems. 
      Mr. Eno is a great resource if they can't help you. It is highly encouraged to do projects.</p>

      <!-- Testout Paragraphs by Lantis Hegg -->
    <p> <h2> <a href="https://www.testout.com"> <img src="Images/602ec56f257cbcd9c60b3308_testout_logo.png"> </h2></a> </p>
    <p> Most of you will be familar with Testout by now. Testout is owned by CompTIA and runs labsim. 
      Gernearlly you should be completing Testout chapter by chapter, if you ever are late to a chapter exam Mr. Eno will activate the exam again when asked.
      Testout is the source of the certifications this class offers and other than cisco is the main work.
      The room has a labsim accelerator, this is a little prone to breaking so if testout is particulaly slow be sure to bring it up with an L3 or admin.
      I suggest that you take more than 1 testout Certification at a time if you are willing.
      Going above and beyond isn't hard, it just takes dedication and patience. Patience is KEY to Testout success.
    </p>

    <p> Testout itself is pretty easy, do the labs and the exams and pass. They have videos and documentation to read optionally.
        It's reccomended to watch the videos and read the material, however feel free to pass it if you are confident and manage to pass the exam.
        If a lab keeps failing you then watch the video and follow it EXACTLY, Testout will require you do it the exact way they show it.

    <p> Intro to Networking for Cisco is the first course that is designed for students who want to learn networking and improve their skills in the field. 
      It is tough work but if you want it you will be able to achieve it and learn a lot of knowledge and have skills to be able to apply in the real world. 
      It is mostly reading but if you take your time and are careful it will help you. 
      There are labs that are along the way which are done and turned into google classroom while the exams are done through the cisco interface. 
      I suggest trying to go through all three courses of the CCNA. This is part one and there are two others. 
      Through Eno's class you can take part one and two but if you would like you may take the third one and get your CCNA Certification.

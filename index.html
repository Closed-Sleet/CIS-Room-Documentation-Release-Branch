    <h1>CIS Room Documentation</h1>
    <p>The CIS room refers to MR.Eno's classroom itself.</p>
    <p>This is the general documentation of the room.</p>
    <p>Please update this documentation as the room changes and gets upgraded.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id='Gen_stuff'>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> This Documentation will cover almost everything in the CIS room from a hardware and software perspective. There will also be a lot of specs lists here.</p>
    <p style="float: clear;">If you want to do something or test something feel free to do so. This class has a lot of resources that are dedicated for your use. 
      Most questions should be directed towards the L3's present in the class as they will generally be able to help with most issues/problems. 
      Mr. Eno is a great resource if they can't help you. It is highly encouraged to do projects.</p>

    <h2> Testout </h2>
    <p> Most of you will be familar with testout by now. Testout is owned by CompTIA and runs labsim. 
      Gernearlly you should be completeding Testout chapter by chapter, if you ever are late to a chapter exam Mr. Eno will activate the exam again if needed.
      Testout is the source of the certifications this class offers and other than cisco is the main work.
      The room has a labsim accelerator, this is a little prone to breaking so if testout is particulaly slow be sure to bring it up with an L3 or admin.  
    </p>

    <p> Testout itself is pretty easy, do the labs and the exams and pass. They have videos and documentation to read optionally.
        It's reccomended to watch the videos and read the material however feel free to pass it if you are confident and manage to pass the exam.
        If a lab keeps failing you then watch the video and follow it EXACTLY, Testout will require you do it the exact way they show it.  
    </p>
